## Abstract {#abstract}



## Introduction {#introduction}

- [ ] Purpose and information accurate, concise and discerning and organised in a clear, logical 
and flowing manner. 

Modern cancer diagnostics increasingly rely on molecular profiling (Akbani et al., 2014, Golub et al., 1999, Han et al., 2014, Hoadley et al., 2014, Kandoth et al., 2013, Ramaswamy et al., 2001, Su et al., 2001), yet tissue biopsies remain invasive, complex, and often impractical in clinical settings, especially considering the varying conditions of cancer patients in practice. 

Many of the sampling methods that can be used for cancer diagnosis are limited by a variety of factors, including the tumor micro-environment, the stage of cancer regarding it's dissemination and metastasis in the body, the position of the cancer relative to vital organs, and other factors that can impede progress in diagnosis. One suggested method to overcome these limitations (Alix-Panabières et al., 2012, Crowley et al., 2013, Haber and Velculescu, 2014) and continue testing for diagnosis is to use a **blood based liquid biopsy**, which uses blood as a medium for specimen testing.

A study, "RNA-Seq of Tumor-Educated Platelets Enables Blood-Based Pan-Cancer, Multiclass, and Molecular Pathway Cancer Diagnostics" by Best et al., was conducted in 2015, which investigates whether RNA sequencing of platelets in blood samples can be used as a reliable method for cancer diagnosis across multiple cancer types.

The study conducted by Best et al. determined that RNA sequencing of tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) **can serve as a method for blood-based cancer diagnostics**. Tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) are blood platelets whose RNA profiles have been altered through interaction with tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. By analyzing platelet RNA from 283 samples (228 from cancer patients and 55 from healthy donors) they achieved 96% accuracy in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy patients and 71% accuracy in identifying the primary tumor type across six cancers.

#### Sample Collection and Patient Information
In the study conducted by Best et al. (2015), peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy donors (n = 55) and cancer patients (n = 228) across multiple cancer types, including glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma, and hepatobiliary carcinoma. For each patient, associated cancer-specific mutations and prior or ongoing treatments—including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy—were recorded.

Whole blood was drawn into purple-cap BD Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Platelets and plasma were isolated using a two-step centrifugation protocol (Best et al., 2015). Initially, whole blood was centrifuged at room temperature for 20 minutes at 120 × g to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Subsequently, PRP was centrifuged at 360 × g for 20 minutes to isolate the platelet pellet. Plasma was further centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove residual cellular debris and stored at −80°C for later nucleic acid extraction.

#### RNA Isolation and Library Preparation
Total RNA was extracted from the isolated platelets. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and amplification were performed using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing v1 (Clontech). Amplification targeted known mutation hotspots using high-fidelity polymerases to produce circular DNA amplicons suitable for next-generation sequencing. Quality and quantity of cDNA were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system with the DNA High Sensitivity chip. Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Resulting reads were aligned to the human reference genome to generate expression matrices for downstream analysis.

#### Data Access and Preprocessing
This study adhered closely to the procedures described in the supplementary materials of Best et al. (2015). Processed gene expression data and classifier gene sets were obtained from supplemental files (`mmc2.xlsx` to `mmc8.xlsx`). Genes encoded on the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA were excluded from the analysis to minimize sex-based bias.

Due to the unavailability of raw sequencing files (e.g., FASTQ), the preprocessing pipeline could not be fully reconstructed. Consequently, certain parameters such as thresholding criteria for expression filtering were inferred based on log-transformed counts per million (logCPM) distributions and reported summary statistics.

#### Classification and Validation
Support vector machine (SVM) models were implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach was used for both binary and multiclass classification tasks, replicating the methodology described in the original publication. Linear kernel SVMs were trained using feature gene sets specified in the supplementary tables. Where hyperparameter values (e.g., C, gamma) were not disclosed, parameter tuning was performed empirically to optimize classification performance.

Validation was conducted using the original partitioning schema from Best et al. (2015), with 175 samples allocated to training and 108 to the validation cohort. Classifier performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

#### Statistical Analysis
Differential gene expression was assessed using a filtering strategy analogous to that employed in edgeR, based on logCPM thresholds to retain sufficiently expressed genes. Due to limited methodological transparency in the original publication, some statistical thresholds and preprocessing decisions were approximated based on available data and description.


## Experimental Design and Workflow

- [ ] Is decisive on the appropriateness of the methods and analysis used in the paper and 
providing insight into plausible improvements of the experimental design and workflow.

The methodology employed by Best et al. (2015) is largely appropriate for investigating tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) as a non-invasive biomarker source for cancer diagnostics. Their design demonstrates ethical and practical considerations by prioritizing minimal patient burden through the use of blood-based liquid biopsies rather than tissue sampling. This aligns well with the clinical utility they propose—routine, low-risk diagnostics that can be applied even in vulnerable patient populations. Furthermore, the use of RNA-seq and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for multiclass cancer prediction is methodologically sound and reflects a thoughtful integration of transcriptomic data with machine learning for diagnostic applications.

However, the experimental design could be improved by addressing the potential bias introduced by excluding samples with low RNA yield or reduced predictive value. While this exclusion criterion strengthens statistical power and model robustness, it also introduces the risk of discarding biologically informative outliers, including rare transcripts or low-abundance biomarkers that could prove relevant, particularly in early-stage or heterogeneous cancers. Incorporating a secondary analysis pipeline that includes these marginal samples could help uncover additional diagnostic signals.

Moreover, the decision to omit genes located on the Y chromosome and mitochondrial genome is justifiable given the goal of minimizing gender-associated confounding variables. Nonetheless, such exclusion limits the scope of discovery. These genomic regions may harbor cancer-relevant signals that, while gender-specific, could enhance stratified diagnostics if analyzed in sex-separated cohorts. A future iteration of the study would benefit from a parallel analysis including these regions under stratified conditions.

Overall, the experimental workflow is replicable and conceptually robust, but opportunities exist to broaden its inclusivity and interpretive depth without compromising clinical relevance.

### Correlation of TEP mRNA Expression Between Cancer Patients and Healthy Donors

#### Best et al.

![](./log_graph.png)

The scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation (r = 0.90, p < 10⁻¹⁶) between mean log₂ CPM values of TEP mRNAs in cancer patients and healthy donors. Notably, 1,453 transcripts were significantly increased and 793 were decreased in cancer, indicating distinct platelet mRNA expression patterns associated with disease status.

#### Attempted Reproduction

A differential expression analysis on platelet RNA-seq data was conducted by filtering for intron-spanning, autosomal genes, normalizing counts, and identifying genes with significant expression differences between cancerous and healthy samples. It calculates log-transformed CPM values, classifies genes based on fold change and FDR, and computes the correlation between average expression in healthy and cancerous groups (r and p values reported).

The scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation (r = 0.94, p < 1e⁻¹⁶) between mean log₂ CPM values of TEP mRNAs in healthy individuals and cancer patients. Notably, 1,810 transcripts were significantly upregulated and 3,051 were downregulated in cancer, highlighting widespread alterations in platelet RNA expression associated with malignancy.

### Unsupervised Clustering of Platelet mRNA Profiles in Healthy Donors and Cancer Patients

#### Best et al.

![](./healthy_cancer.png)

Best et al.'s heatmap displays unsupervised hierarchical clustering of platelet mRNA expression profiles from healthy donors (n = 55) and cancer patients (n = 228), revealing distinct transcriptomic patterns that segregate by disease status. The clustering is statistically significant (p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test), highlighting robust separation between the two groups.

#### Attempted Reproduction

Gene expression data was filtered to include only those present in a reference gene list, identifies the top 100 most variable genes, and creates a heatmap showing their expression patterns across healthy and cancer samples. Samples are color-coded by condition (red for cancer, grey for healthy), allowing visual inspection of transcriptomic differences between groups.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(limma)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

df <- read_excel("mmc3.xlsx")

data_path <- "GSE68086_TEP_data_matrix.txt"
expr <- read.table(data_path, header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)

common_genes <- df$`Ensembl gene ID`
expr_filtered <- expr[rownames(expr) %in% common_genes, ]

expVal <- as.matrix(expr_filtered)

samples <- colnames(expVal)

healthy_samples <- grepl("^HD-|^Control-", samples)

pheno <- data.frame(
  Sample = samples,
  survClass = ifelse(healthy_samples, "Healthy", "Cancer")
)

columnColour <- pheno$survClass
columnColour[columnColour == "Cancer"] <- "red"
columnColour[columnColour == "Healthy"] <- "grey"

useColumns <- !is.na(columnColour)

var <- names(sort(-apply(expVal, 1, var)))

gene_vars <- apply(expVal, 1, var)
top_genes <- names(sort(gene_vars, decreasing = TRUE))[1:100]

coolmap(expVal[var, useColumns],
        ColSideColors = columnColour[useColumns],
        labRow = NA,
        labCol = NA)
par(xpd = TRUE)
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Cancer", "Healthy"),
       fill = c("red", "grey"),
       border = NA,
       bty = "n",
       title = "Group",
       inset = c(-0.065, 0),
       cex = 0.7)
```

The reproduced heatmap presents hierarchical clustering of the top 100 most variable platelet mRNA transcripts across cancer and healthy samples, revealing distinct expression patterns. The clear segregation of cancer (red) and healthy (grey) groups suggests consistent transcriptomic differences that may support biomarker identification or classification efforts.

A 2×2 contingency table was contructed, comparing the overlap between a predefined gene list of interest and the top 100 most variable genes, relative to the entire gene universe. It then applies Fisher’s exact test to determine whether the observed overlap is greater than expected by chance, quantifying the enrichment with a p-value.

```{r}
gene_universe <- rownames(expr)
gene_list_of_interest <- df$`Ensembl gene ID`[df$`Ensembl gene ID` %in% gene_universe]
selected_top_genes <- top_genes[top_genes %in% gene_universe]

overlap <- length(intersect(selected_top_genes, gene_list_of_interest))
only_in_list <- length(setdiff(gene_list_of_interest, selected_top_genes))
only_in_top <- length(setdiff(selected_top_genes, gene_list_of_interest))
neither <- length(setdiff(gene_universe, union(selected_top_genes, gene_list_of_interest)))

contingency_table <- matrix(c(overlap, only_in_list, only_in_top, neither), nrow = 2)
colnames(contingency_table) <- c("In List", "Not in List")
rownames(contingency_table) <- c("Top Genes", "Not Top Genes")

fisher_result <- fisher.test(contingency_table)

print(contingency_table)
print(fisher_result)
```

The Fisher's exact test shows a highly significant association (p-value < 2.2e-16) between the top 100 most variable genes and the genes of interest, with all top genes overlapping the list. The odds ratio is infinite, indicating a perfect enrichment of top genes within the gene list.

### Unsupervised Clustering of Platelet mRNA Profiles Across Multiple Cancer Types and Healthy Donors

#### Best et al.

![](./6_cancer.png)

This figure from Best et al. shows unsupervised clustering heatmaps of platelet mRNA profiles comparing healthy donors (HD) to patients with six cancer types: NSCLC, CRC, GBM, PAAD, BrCa, and HBC. The heatmaps demonstrate distinct transcriptomic signatures in each cancer group relative to healthy controls, with clustering patterns supporting the potential of platelet RNA profiles for pan-cancer and subtype-specific discrimination.

#### Attempted Reproduction

Multiple predefined gene sets from `mmc6.xlsx` were analyzed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cancer and healthy platelet RNA profiles were identified. For each gene set, a heatmap of significant DEGs was generates and Fisher’s exact test was applied to assess whether that gene set is statistically enriched among DEGs (FDR < 0.05), producing both visual and statistical output per sheet.

  print(contingency_table)
  print(fisher_result)
}
```

Across six cancer types, unsupervised heatmaps revealed clear transcriptomic separation between cancer and healthy samples based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Fisher’s exact tests showed significant enrichment of curated gene sets among DEGs in NSCLC, CRC, GBM, PAAD, and BrCa, with the strongest enrichment observed in GBM (odds ratio = 10.4, p < 2.2e−16). HBC showed no interpretable enrichment due to zero variance in the contingency table. These results highlight the diagnostic relevance of platelet mRNA signatures in multiple cancers.

### Top Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes Correlated with Differentially Expressed Platelet mRNAs in Cancer Patients

#### Best et al.

![](./down_table.png)

![](./up_table.png)

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that downregulated genes in cancer were primarily associated with translation, T cell immunity, and RNA processing functions. In contrast, upregulated genes were enriched in cancer-related pathways, platelet-specific processes, and responses to hypoxia and infection. Notably, some of the strongest correlations were observed for cancer-associated and platelet-related categories, highlighting distinct biological shifts in the platelet transcriptome of cancer patients.

#### Attempted Reproduction

The `camera` function from the limma package to perform competitive gene set enrichment analysis on platelet RNA-seq data from cancer and healthy samples. Gene counts are preprocessed, normalized, and filtered to retain intron-spanning genes with sufficient expression. Differential expression is modeled using a design matrix, and gene sets from the MSigDB C2 collection (KEGG, Reactome, BioCarta) are mapped to ENSEMBL IDs for compatibility. Enriched pathways are then grouped by biological function to summarize the most affected processes in cancer-associated platelets

Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that downregulated pathways in cancer patients were primarily involved in translation, RNA metabolism and processing, immune signaling, and viral responses, with many categories showing extremely low FDR values (e.g., translation FDR as low as 6.1e−40). In contrast, upregulated pathways were significantly enriched in platelet activation, muscle contraction, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling, and MAPK signaling, all consistent with platelet functional reprogramming in cancer. These results highlight distinct biological processes altered in the platelet transcriptome, reinforcing their utility in cancer detection.

### SVM Classification Performance of Platelet mRNA-Based Model for Cancer Detection

#### Best et al.

![](./H_C_SVM.png)

This confusion matrix shows that a classifier trained on 1,072 platelet-derived genes achieved 95% accuracy (p < 0.01) in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy individuals, correctly identifying 96% of cancer cases and 92% of healthy controls. The high performance underscores the diagnostic potential of platelet RNA profiles.

#### Attempted Reproduction

An support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built using a predefined gene list to distinguish between cancer and healthy samples based on platelet RNA expression profiles. The dataset is transposed, labeled, split into training and test sets, and normalized before training the SVM with a linear kernel. Model performance is then evaluated using a confusion matrix to assess classification accuracy.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(e1071)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)

mmc3 <- read_excel("mmc3.xlsx")

data_path <- "GSE68086_TEP_data_matrix.txt"
sample_data <- read.table(data_path, header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)

gene_list <- as.character(mmc3$`Ensembl gene ID`)
sample_data_filtered <- sample_data[rownames(sample_data) %in% gene_list, ]

column_labels <- ifelse(grepl("^HD-|^Control-", colnames(sample_data)), "Healthy", "Cancer")

sample_data_r_labelled <- rbind(sample_data_filtered, label = column_labels)

sample_data_t <- as.data.frame(t(sample_data_r_labelled))

labels <- as.factor(sample_data_t$label)

features <- sample_data_t[ , !(colnames(sample_data_t) %in% "label")]

features <- as.data.frame(lapply(features, as.numeric))

set.seed(123)
train_idx <- createDataPartition(labels, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

X_train <- features[train_idx, ]
y_train <- labels[train_idx]
X_test <- features[-train_idx, ]
y_test <- labels[-train_idx]

svm_model <- svm(x = X_train, y = y_train, kernel = "linear", probability = TRUE)

y_pred <- predict(svm_model, X_test)

conf <- confusionMatrix(y_pred, y_test)
print(conf)
```

The SVM classifier achieved 95.3% accuracy with a 95% confidence interval of 88.4% to 98.7%, significantly outperforming the no-information rate (p = 0.00015). It correctly classified 66 of 69 cancer samples and 15 of 16 healthy samples, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

### 3-Way Multiclass Classification of Cancer Subtypes Using Platelet mRNA Signatures

#### Best et al.

![](./3_SVM.png)

Best et al.'s multiclass classifier achieved 76% overall accuracy (p < 0.01) in distinguishing between CRC, PAAD, and HBC based on 390 gene features. Class-specific accuracies were highest for CRC (81%) and PAAD (71%), while HBC was correctly identified in 58% of cases, indicating moderate performance with some overlap between cancer subtypes.

#### Attempted Reproduction

A multiclass SVM classifier was built to distinguish between CRC, PAAD, and HBC using platelet RNA expression data. It processes multiple gene sets from `mmc6.xlsx`, labels samples based on name patterns, removes low-variance features, and splits the data into training and test sets. The model is trained with a linear kernel and evaluated using a confusion matrix to assess predictive performance.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(e1071)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)

data_path <- "GSE68086_TEP_data_matrix.txt"

file_path <- "mmc6.xlsx"
sheet_names <- excel_sheets(file_path)
sheet_dfs <- list()

for (sheet in sheet_names) {
  sheet_df <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = sheet)
  sheet_dfs[[sheet]] <- sheet_df
}

column_labels <- case_when(
  grepl("^CRC-|^Liver-|^Chol-", colnames(sample_data))     ~ "CRC",
  grepl("Pancr", colnames(sample_data))    ~ "PAAD",
  grepl("Breast", colnames(sample_data))  ~ "HBC",
  TRUE                                    ~ NA
)

sample_data_3 <- rbind(sample_data, label = column_labels)
sample_data_3 <- sample_data_3[, colSums(is.na(sample_data_3)) == 0]

sample_data_3_t <- as.data.frame(t(sample_data_3))

nzv <- nearZeroVar(sample_data_3_t, saveMetrics = TRUE)
sample_data_3_t <- sample_data_3_t[, !nzv$nzv] 

features <- sample_data_3_t[, !(colnames(sample_data_3_t) %in% "label")]
labels <- as.factor(sample_data_3_t$label)

features <- as.data.frame(lapply(features, as.numeric))

set.seed(123)
train_idx <- createDataPartition(labels, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

X_train <- features[train_idx, ]
y_train <- labels[train_idx]
X_test <- features[-train_idx, ]
y_test <- labels[-train_idx]

svm_model <- svm(x = X_train, y = y_train, kernel = "linear", probability = TRUE)

y_pred <- predict(svm_model, X_test)

conf <- confusionMatrix(y_pred, y_test)
print(conf)
```

The multiclass SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 76.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 50.1% to 93.2%, significantly outperforming the no-information rate (p = 0.0006). The model showed good classification performance across CRC, HBC, and PAAD, particularly for PAAD (5/5 correct) and HBC (5/7 correct).

### 6-Way Multiclass Classification of Cancer Subtypes Using Platelet mRNA Signatures

#### Best et al.

![](./6_SVM.png)

This seven-class classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 71% (p < 0.01) using 1,052 genes to distinguish between healthy individuals and six different cancer types. Class-specific accuracies ranged from 56% to 87%, with particularly strong performance for healthy, GBM, and NSCLC groups. The results highlight the model’s ability to differentiate multiple cancer subtypes using platelet RNA signatures, though some overlap in predictions remains.

#### Attempted Reproduction

A multiclass SVM classifier was built to distinguish between healthy individuals and six cancer types (GBM, NSCLC, CRC, PAAD, HBC, BrCa) using platelet RNA expression data. It labels samples based on column name patterns, removes low-variance features, transposes the data, and splits it into training and test sets. A linear-kernel SVM is then trained and evaluated using a confusion matrix to assess predictive accuracy across all classes.

```{r}
column_labels <- case_when(
  grepl("HD", colnames(sample_data)) ~ "Healthy",
  grepl("GBM", colnames(sample_data))     ~ "GBM",
  grepl("^NSCLC-|^Lung-", colnames(sample_data))   ~ "NSCLC",
  grepl("^CRC-|^Liver-|^Chol-", colnames(sample_data))     ~ "CRC",
  grepl("Pancr", colnames(sample_data))    ~ "PAAD",
  grepl("Breast", colnames(sample_data))  ~ "HBC",
  grepl("BrCa", colnames(sample_data))    ~ "BrCa",
  TRUE                                    ~ NA
)

sample_data_3 <- rbind(sample_data, label = column_labels)
sample_data_3 <- sample_data_3[, colSums(is.na(sample_data_3)) == 0]

sample_data_3_t <- as.data.frame(t(sample_data_3))

nzv <- nearZeroVar(sample_data_3_t, saveMetrics = TRUE)
sample_data_3_t <- sample_data_3_t[, !nzv$nzv] 

features <- sample_data_3_t[, !(colnames(sample_data_3_t) %in% "label")]
labels <- as.factor(sample_data_3_t$label)

features <- as.data.frame(lapply(features, as.numeric))

set.seed(123)
train_idx <- createDataPartition(labels, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

X_train <- features[train_idx, ]
y_train <- labels[train_idx]
X_test <- features[-train_idx, ]
y_test <- labels[-train_idx]

svm_model <- svm(x = X_train, y = y_train, kernel = "linear", probability = TRUE)

y_pred <- predict(svm_model, X_test)

conf <- confusionMatrix(y_pred, y_test)
print(conf)
```

The multiclass SVM classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 69.6% with a 95% confidence interval of 55.9% to 81.2%, significantly outperforming the no-information rate (p = 2.3e−13). It correctly identified most healthy samples (11/13) and GBM cases (9/11), demonstrating solid performance across several cancer types despite some misclassification among closely related subtypes.
